# Secrets

This is a reference for all the secrets that must be provisioned manually for the cluster to be operational. 
These secrets are normally on an external USB key mounted at `/mnt` under the path `/mnt/secrets/manifests`.

All the secrets have been redacted and are meant as a reference for anyone who might happen to be interested
in my lab setup.
